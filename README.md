## About

I often want to bootstrap a project with some tooling, but have found that not every project fits the exact same needs.

A better way might be to use a tool like Cookie Cutter, but I need a minimal start right now.

This repo will contain some general configuration files for usage with pre-commit, linting, and others that I might want to drop into a new repo.

## Getting Started

Install [File Vault](https://github.com/zaguiini/vscode-file-vault) and point to this repo.

Grab the required files for a new project.

## Prerequisites

Optional: VSCode & [File Vault](https://github.com/zaguiini/vscode-file-vault)

## Credits
